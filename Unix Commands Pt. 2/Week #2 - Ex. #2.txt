5-How many addresses are there for yahoo.com? Use nslookup command.
	Command: echo `nslookup yahoo.com | grep "Address" | wc -l` -1 | bc
	Result: 3

Note: this finds the the word "Address" which is associated with the IP address in the result and counts it. I subtracted one because the local machine address iss always counted for.

Note: This searches for /bin/bash keyword which is associated with human-made users and root user, and I subtract '1' to make sure that root does not count.
